# Entur-villaveien

My roommate wanted a dashboard for when the busses from Møhlenpris leaves for NHH. With the Entur API I created a simple overview of when the busses leaves for an Ipad in our shared flat.

The minutes color is updated based on when it is best to leave the apartment. Based on the average walking speed on Google maps you would not have to wait more 2-4 min at Møhlenpris to get your bus to NHH.
